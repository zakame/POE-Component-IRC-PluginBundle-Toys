    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a silly little module which allows you to spice up your "error"
or "no result" messages with a little wit. It is to be used as a plugin
for L<POE::Component::IRC>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new>

    # plain
    $irc->plugin_add(
        'SigFail' => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::SigFail->new
    );

    # strawberry-vanilla
    $irc->plugin_add(
        'SigFail' => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::SigFail->new(
            tag         => qr/<irc_sigfail:([^>]+)>/,
            messages    => [
                q|No idea|,
                q|No clue|,
            ],
            extra       => [
                q|Wtf is that?|,
                q|Umm.. Google it|,
            ],
            sigfail     => 1,
        )
    );

Constructs and returns a new POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::SigFail object
which is suitable to be fed into C<plugin_add> method of
L<POE::Component::IRC> object.

The constructor takes a few arguments I<all of which are optional> and
are passed as key/value pairs. All arguments can be changed dynamically
by assigning to them as hashref keys in your plugin's object. In other
words, if you want to change the value of C<sigfail> argument you can
simply do C<< $your_sigfail_plugin_object->{sigfail} = 0; >>.
The possible arguments are as follows:

=head3 C<tag>

    ->new( tag => qr/<irc_sigfail:([^>]+)>/, );

B<Optional>. The way the plugin works is it looks for special "tags"
in outgoing C<privmsg> and C<notice> messages. The "tag" is a regex
(C<qr//>) which is given as a value to constructor's C<tag> argument.
The regex must have one capturing group of parenthesis. When C<sigfail>
argument (see below) is set to a true value the plugin will replace the
entire "tag" with one of the "witty messages". If C<sigfail> argument
is set to a false value, the "tag" will be replaced with whatever was
captured by capturing ground of parentheses. This allows you to specify
"real" error/no result messages in your tags and dynamically change
values of C<sigfail> argument in case you need to know the actual message.
B<Defaults to:> C<< qr/<irc_sigfail:([^>]+)>/ >>.

=head3 C<messages>

    ->new( messages => [
                q|No idea|,
                q|No clue|,
            ],
    );

B<Optional>. The C<messages> argument is the heart of the plugin. It takes
an arrayref as a value elements of which are "witty messages" with which
the tag will be replaced. The default set of C<messages> is presented
in "MESSAGES" section below. If you want to just add a few more messages
see the C<extra> argument below. If you have some nice and funny messages
suitable for this plugin please tell me about them at C<zoffix@cpan.org>
and I will be more than happy to add them to the "core". B<Defaults to:>
an arrayref containing all the messages presented in "MESSAGES" section
below.

=head3 C<extra>

    ->new( extra => [
                q|Wtf is that?|,
                q|Umm.. Google it|,
            ],
    );

B<Optional>. If you simply to want to add a few C<messages> of your own
instead of completely replacing the C<messages> arrayref (see above) simply
assign them to C<extra> argument. The C<extra> argument takes an arrayref
as a value elements of which will be appended to C<messages> arrayref
(see description above). B<Defaults to:> C<[]> (empty arrayref).

=head3 C<sigfail>

    ->new( sigfail => 1, );

B<Optional>. This is the "controlling switch" of the plugin. It takes
either true or false values as a value. When set to a true value the
"tag" (see above) will be replaced with one of the witty messages given via
C<messages> argument. When set to a false value the "tag" will be replaced
with whatever was captured in the first group of capturing parenthesis
of the C<tag> argument's regex (see above). B<Defaults to:> C<1>

=head1 MESSAGES

The following are default "witty messages" with which you "tag" will
be replaced; i.e. the default elements of C<messages> argument arrayref.

    [
        q|No idea|,
        q|No clue|,
