=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bringing answers to life questions - Magic 8 Ball goes IRC!

This module is a L<POE::Component::IRC> plugin which uses
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin> for its base.
It accepts input from public channel events, C</notice> messages as well
as C</msg> (private messages); although that can be configured at will.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new>

    # plain and simple
    $irc->plugin_add(
        'Magic8Ball' => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Magic8Ball->new
    );

    # juicy flavor
    $irc->plugin_add(
        'Magic8Ball' =>
            POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Magic8Ball->new(
                auto             => 1,
                response_event   => 'irc_magic_8_ball',
                banned           => [ qr/aol\.com$/i ],
                root             => [ qr/mah.net$/i ],
                addressed        => 1,
                trigger          => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
                triggers         => {
                    public  => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
                    notice  => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
                    privmsg => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S))/i,
                },
                listen_for_input => [ qw(public notice privmsg) ],
                eat              => 1,
                debug            => 0,
            )
    );

The C<new()> method constructs and returns a new
C<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Magic8Ball> object suitable to be
fed to L<POE::Component::IRC>'s C<plugin_add> method. The constructor
takes a few arguments, but I<all of them are optional>. B<Note:>
you can change the values of the arguments dynamically by accessing
them as hashref keys in your plugin's object; e.g. to ban some
user during runtime simply do
C<< push @{ $your_plugin_object->{banned} }, qr/user!mask/ >>
The possible arguments/values are as follows:

=head3 C<auto>

    ->new( auto => 0 );

B<Optional>. Takes either true or false values, specifies whether or not
the plugin should auto respond to requests. When the C<auto>
argument is set to a true value plugin will respond to the requesting
person with the results automatically. When the C<auto> argument
is set to a false value plugin will not respond and you will have to
listen to the events emitted by the plugin to retrieve the results (see
EMITTED EVENTS section and C<response_event> argument for details).
B<Defaults to:> C<1>.

=head3 C<response_event>

    ->new( response_event => 'event_name_to_receive_results' );

B<Optional>. Takes a scalar string specifying the name of the event
to emit when the results of the request are ready. See EMITTED EVENTS
section for more information. B<Defaults to:> C<irc_magic_8_ball>

=head3 C<banned>

    ->new( banned => [ qr/aol\.com$/i ] );

B<Optional>. Takes an arrayref of regexes as a value. If the usermask
of the person (or thing) making the request matches any of
the regexes listed in the C<banned> arrayref, plugin will ignore the
request. B<Defaults to:> C<[]> (no bans are set).

=head3 C<root>

    ->new( root => [ qr/\Qjust.me.and.my.friend.net\E$/i ] );

B<Optional>. As opposed to C<banned> argument, the C<root> argument
B<allows> access only to people whose usermasks match B<any> of
the regexen you specify in the arrayref the argument takes as a value.
B<By default:> it is not specified. B<Note:> as opposed to C<banned>
specifying an empty arrayref to C<root> argument will restrict
access to everyone.

=head3 C<trigger>

    ->new( trigger => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i );

B<Optional>. Takes a regex as an argument. Messages matching this
regex, irrelevant of the type of the message, will be considered as requests. See also
B<addressed> option below which is enabled by default as well as
B<triggers> option which is more specific. B<Note:> the
trigger will be B<removed> from the message, therefore make sure your
trigger doesn't match the actual data that needs to be processed.
B<Defaults to:> C<qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i>

=head3 C<triggers>

    ->new( triggers => {
            public  => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
            notice  => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
            privmsg => qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i,
        }
    );

B<Optional>. Takes a hashref as an argument which may contain either
one or all of keys B<public>, B<notice> and B<privmsg> which indicates
the type of messages: channel messages, notices and private messages
respectively. The values of those keys are regexes of the same format and
meaning as for the C<trigger> argument (see above).
Messages matching this
regex will be considered as requests. The difference is that only messages of type corresponding to the key of C<triggers> hashref
are checked for the trigger. B<Note:> the C<trigger> will be matched
irrelevant of the setting in C<triggers>, thus you can have one global and specific "local" triggers. See also
B<addressed> option below which is enabled by default as well as
B<triggers> option which is more specific. B<Note:> the
trigger will be B<removed> from the message, therefore make sure your
trigger doesn't match the actual data that needs to be processed.
B<Defaults to:> C<qr/^8\s*ball\s+(?=\S)/i>

=head3 C<addressed>

    ->new( addressed => 1 );

B<Optional>. Takes either true or false values. When set to a true value
all the public messages must be I<addressed to the bot>. In other words,
if your bot's nickname is C<Nick> and your trigger is
C<qr/^trig\s+/>
you would make the request by saying C<Nick, trig EXAMPLE>.
When addressed mode is turned on, the bot's nickname, including any
whitespace and common punctuation character will be removed before
matching the C<trigger> (see above). When C<addressed> argument it set
to a false value, public messages will only have to match C<trigger> regex
in order to make a request. Note: this argument has no effect on
C</notice> and C</msg> requests. B<Defaults to:> C<1>

=head3 C<listen_for_input>

    ->new( listen_for_input => [ qw(public  notice  privmsg) ] );

B<Optional>. Takes an arrayref as a value which can contain any of the
three elements, namely C<public>, C<notice> and C<privmsg> which indicate
which kind of input plugin should respond to. When the arrayref contains
C<public> element, plugin will respond to requests sent from messages
in public channels (see C<addressed> argument above for specifics). When
the arrayref contains C<notice> element plugin will respond to
requests sent to it via C</notice> messages. When the arrayref contains
C<privmsg> element, the plugin will respond to requests sent
to it via C</msg> (private messages). You can specify any of these. In
other words, setting C<( listen_for_input => [ qr(notice privmsg) ] )>
will enable functionality only via C</notice> and C</msg> messages.
B<Defaults to:> C<[ qw(public  notice  privmsg) ]>

=head3 C<eat>

    ->new( eat => 0 );

B<Optional>. If set to a false value plugin will return a
C<PCI_EAT_NONE> after
responding. If eat is set to a true value, plugin will return a
C<PCI_EAT_ALL> after responding. See L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin>
documentation for more information if you are interested. B<Defaults to>:
C<1>

=head3 C<debug>

    ->new( debug => 1 );

B<Optional>. Takes either a true or false value. When C<debug> argument
is set to a true value some debugging information will be printed out.
When C<debug> argument is set to a false value no debug info will be
printed. B<Defaults to:> C<0>.

=head1 EMITTED EVENTS

=head2 C<response_event>

    $VAR1 = {
        'who' => 'Zoffix!n=Zoffix@unaffiliated/zoffix',
        'what' => 'do you like me?',
        'response' => [
            'Zoffix, My sources say no.'
        ],
        'type' => 'public',
        'channel' => '#zofbot',
        'message' => 'Magic8BallBot, 8ball do you like me?'
    };

The event handler set up to handle the event, name of which you've
specified in the C<response_event> argument to the constructor
(it defaults to C<irc_magic_8_ball>) will receive input
every time request is completed. The input will come in C<$_[ARG0]>
on a form of a hashref.
The possible keys/values of that hashrefs are as follows:

=head3 C<response>

    'response' => [
        'Zoffix, My sources say no.'
    ],

The C<response> key will have an arrayref as it's value. The arrayref will have only one
element (don't ask why it's an arrayref at all) which is the 8-ball response.

=head3 C<who>

    { 'who' => 'Zoffix!Zoffix@i.love.debian.org', }

The C<who> key will contain the user mask of the user who sent the request.

=head3 C<what>

    { 'what' => 'do you like me?', }

The C<what> key will contain user's message after stripping the C<trigger>
(see CONSTRUCTOR).

=head3 C<message>

    { 'message' => 'Magic8BallBot, 8ball do you like me?' }

The C<message> key will contain the actual message which the user sent; that
is before the trigger is stripped.

=head3 C<type>

    { 'type' => 'public', }

The C<type> key will contain the "type" of the message the user have sent.
This will be either C<public>, C<privmsg> or C<notice>.

=head3 C<channel>

    { 'channel' => '#zofbot', }

The C<channel> key will contain the name of the channel where the message
originated. This will only make sense if C<type> key contains C<public>.
